     * Class Relationships:
     * 
     * 1. Composition
     *    note: if Class A is linked to Class B (by means of composition) that means that Class A instance cannot exist without first
     *          creating an instance of Class B
     *    ex:   Auto Dealer System, you cannot have a Vehicle instance without having a instance of the Engine
     *    ex:   Interior Design System, a House instance must have at least 1 Room instance
     *    
     * 2. Aggregation
     * 3. Association
     * 4. Inheritance 
     *    note: a class inherits from another class, it means it inherits the public members. 
     *    ex: a Warrior is a Character (in a game) because Warrior inherits from Character
